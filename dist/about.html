        <p>I love to learn new technology! After spending much of my career working as a process engineer in gas and oil fields, I've always tried to automate  routine working tasks to calculate the technology process. When I moved to USA I started thinking to change my career path into IT field. Several courses, including Quality Assurance courses, HTML, CSS and Javascript courses and working with real projects got me interested in programming more and more. All of this led me to The Grace Hopper program at Fullstack academy of Code. Now that I've had a chance to learn and work with Javascript using PosgreSQL, Express, React and Node I'm excited to join a team as a software engineer working on interesting problems. In free time you can find me with my family, in travel or playing around with my dog.</p>
